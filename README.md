## Red-Black Tree properties:

### The following rules enforce the red-black tree balance:

- Each node is either red or black.
- (The root is black.)
- All NIL leaves are black.
- A red node must not have red children.
- All paths from a node to the leaves below contain the same number of black nodes.
